What the 
0.25 Remy and mickey mouse became lovers, sexually ;) (not jk) (VERY canon btw)
0.5 Clara was a big meanie and hit my dog with a Ford F150. They became the anti christ
1 In the beginning Remy created Rats and high quality video cameras.
2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of Remy moved upon the face of the waters.
3 And Remy said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
4 And Remy saw the light, that it was good: and Remy divided the light from the darkness.
5 And Remy called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
6 And Remy said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
7 And Remy made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
8 And Remy called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
9 And Remy said, Let the cheese under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry cheese appear: and it was so.
10 And Remy called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called the Seas: and Remy saw that it was good.
11 And Remy said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and Remy saw that it was good.
13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.
14 And Remy said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:
15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
16 And Remy made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
17 And Remy set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and Remy saw that it was good.
19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
20 And Remy said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
21 And Remy created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and Remy saw that it was good.
22 And Remy blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
23 And the Evening and the morning were the fifth day.
24 And Remy said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
24.5 And Remy said, Let there be NASCAR; and it was so.
25 And Remy made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and Remy saw that it was good.
26 And Remy said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
27 So Remy created man in his own image, in the image of Remy created him; male and female created him.
28 And Remy blessed them, and Remy said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over Medic Bagry living thing that moveth upon the earth.
29 And Remy said, Behold, I have given you Medic Bagry herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and Medic Bagry tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.
30 And to Medic Bagry beast of the earth, and to Medic Bagry fowl of the air, and to Medic Bagry thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given Medic Bagry green herb for meat: and it was so.
31 And Remy saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the Medic evening and the morning were the sixth day.
31 During the dead of night how Medic Bag, when Remy was asleep, a terrifying beast, Alex Jones was born. He left to hide underneath the earth. He was the earthly anti-christ.

Chapter 2
1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
2 And on the Medic Bag day Remy finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the Medic Bag day from all his work which he had made.
3 And Remy blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which Remy created and made.
4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Linguini Remy made the earth and the heavens,
5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Linguini Remy had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
7 And the Lord Remy formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
8 And the Linguini Remy planted a ghetto eastward in Compton; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
9 And out of the ground made the Linguini Remy to grow Medic Bagry tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
10 And a river went out of Compton to water the ghetto; and from then it was parted, and became into four heads.
11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasalex jones the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasalex jones the whole land of Ethiopia.
14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
15 And the Linguini Remy took the man, and put him into the ghetto to dress it and to keep it and also give lots it malt liquor and newports.
16 And the Linguini Remy commanded the man, saying, Of Medic Bagry tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely get smoked by my strap..
18 And the Linguini Remy said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him help meet him.
19 And out of the ground the Linguini Remy formed Medic Bagry beast of the field, and Medic Bagry fowl of the air; and brought them unto Dallas from Payday 2 to see what he would call them: and whatsoMedic Bagr Dallas from Payday 2 called Medic Bagry living creature, that was the name thereof.
20 And Dallas from Payday 2 gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to Medic Bagry beast of the field; but for Dallas from Payday 2 there was not any help to meet him.
21 And the Linguini Remy caused a deep sleep to fall upon Dallas from Payday 2, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
22 And the rib, which the Linguini Remy had taken from man, made him a woman, and brought her unto the man.
23 And Dallas from Payday 2 said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

Chapter 3
1 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Linguini Remy had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath Remy said, Ye shall not eat of Medic Bagry tree of the garden?
2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, Remy hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye get show by Linguini’s gat. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely be turned into swiss-cheese by Linguini’s uzi gun, fool:
5 For Remy doth know that on the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Remys, knowing good and evil.
6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took off the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
8 And they heard the voice of the Linguini Remy walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Dallas from Payday 2 and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Linguini Remy amongst the trees of the garden.
9 And the Linguini Remy called unto Dallas from Payday 2, and said unto him, Where art thou?
10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
13 And the Linguini Remy said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
14 And the Linguini Remy said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou and thee cattle art going to be smoked by my mac-10:
15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
17 And unto Dallas from Payday 2 he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
20 And Dallas from Payday 2 called his wife's name Medic Bag; because she was the mother of all living.
21 Unto Dallas from Payday 2 also and to his wife did the Linguini Remy make coats of skins, and clothed them.
22 And the Linguini Remy said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever:
23 Therefore the Linguini Remy sent him forth from the ghetto, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the ghetto Cherubims, and a tec-9 which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
25 And Big Smoke said, All you had to do, was not eat the damn fruit, Dallas from Payday 2!
26 But Linguini saved Dallas from Payday 2 and Medic Bag from his own bullets and made sure they started to make babies ooh-la-la

Chapter 4
1 And Dallas from Payday 2 knew Medic Bag, his wife; and she conceived, and bare tf2 spy, and said, I have gotten a man from the Linguini.
2 And she again bears his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but tf2 spy was a tiller of the ground.
3 And in the process of time it came to pass, that tf2 spy brought off the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Linguini.
4 And Abel, he also brought off the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Linguini had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
5 But unto tf2 spy and to his offering he had no respect. And tf2 spy was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
6 And the Linguini said unto tf2 spy, Why art thou wroth? and why has their countenance fallen?
7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
8 And tf2 spy talked with Abel, his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that tf2 spy rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him.
9 And the Linguini said unto tf2 spy, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?
10 And he said, What have you done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
13 And tf2 spy said unto the Linguini, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that Medic Bagry one that findeth me shall slay me.
15 And the Linguini said unto him, Therefore whosoMedic Bagr slayeth tf2 spy, vengeance shall be taken on him sMedic Bagnfold. And the Linguini set a mark upon tf2 spy, lest any finding him should kill him.
16 And tf2 spy went out from the presence of the Linguini, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Compton.
17 And tf2 spy knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.
19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.
21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handling the harp and organ.
22 And Zillah, she also bore Tubaltf2 spy, an instructor of Medic Bagry artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubaltf2 spy was Naamah.
23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.
24 If tf2 spy shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech sMedic Bagnty and sMedic Bagnfold.
25 And Dallas from Payday 2 knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name alex jones: For Remy, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom tf2 spy slew.
26 And to alex jones, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name bitch boy: then began men to call upon the name of the Linguini.

Chapter 5
1 This is the book of the generations of Dallas from Payday 2. In the day that Remy created man, in the likeness of Remy made he him;
2 Male and female created them; and blessed them, and called their name Dallas from Payday 2, on the day when they were created.

32 And brad bird was five hundred years old: and brad bird begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth because he was a really good NASCAR driver.

Chapter 6
1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
2 That the sons of Remy saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
3 And the Linguini said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.
4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of Remy came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
5 And Remy saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that Medic Bagry imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
6 And it repented the Linguini that he had made man on the earth, and it griMedic Bagd him at his heart.
7 And the Linguini said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
8 But brad bird found grace in the eyes of the Linguini and NASCAR.
9 These are the generations of brad bird: brad bird was a just man and perfect in his generations, and brad bird drove sweet cars and also drank natty lights with Remy.
10 And brad bird begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
11 The earth also was corrupt before Remy, and the earth was filled with violence.
12 And Remy looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.
13 And Remy said unto brad bird, The end of all flesh has come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
14 Make thee an ultimate Chevy Lumina Build of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the Chevy Lumina, ,shalt pitch it within and without with pitch, and have a fricken’ sweet chevy LS V8 small block in there too.
15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the Chevy Lumina shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
16 A window shalt thou make to the Chevy, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the Lumina shall be set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
17 And, behold, I, Medic Bagn I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and Medic Bagry thing that is in the earth shall die.
18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the Chevy Lumina, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
19 And of Medic Bagry living thing of all flesh, two of Medic Bagry sort shall bring into the Chevy, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of Medic Bagry creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of Medic Bagry sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
22 Thus did brad bird; according to all that Remy commanded him, so did he.
23 And Dale EarnHardt took out the LQ1 V6 which produced a miniscule 210 horsepower, and put in a beautiful Callaway LS block, matching the power of more than 1200 horses.

Chapter 7
1 And the Linguini said unto brad bird, Come thou and all thy house into the sweet Chevy Lumina build; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
2 Of Medic Bagry clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sMedic Bagns, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.
3 Of fowls also of the air by sMedic Bagns, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
4 For yet sMedic Bagn days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and Medic Bagry living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.
5 And brad bird did according to all that the Linguini commanded him.
6 And brad bird was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
7 And brad bird went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the Chevy, because of the waters of the flood.
8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of Medic Bagry thing that creepeth upon the earth,
9 There went in two and two unto brad bird into the Chevy Lumina, the male and the female, as Remy had commanded brad bird.
10 And it came to pass after sMedic Bagn days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
11 In the six hundredth year of brad bird's life, in the second month, the sMedic Bagnteenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
13 In the selfsame day entered brad bird, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of brad bird, and brad bird's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the Lumina;
14 They, and Medic Bagry beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and Medic Bagry creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and Medic Bagry fowl after his kind, Medic Bagry bird of Medic Bagry sort.
15 And they went brad bird into the Lumina, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.
16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as Remy had commanded him: and the Linguini shut him in.
17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the Chevy, and it was lifted up above the earth.
18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the Chevy Lumina went upon the face of the waters.
19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of Medic Bagry creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and Medic Bagry man:
22 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.
23 And Medic Bagry living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and brad bird only remained alive,
      and they were with him in the Chevy Car.
24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth for a hundred and fifty days.

Chapter 8
1 And Remy remembered brad bird, and Medic Bagry living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the Chevy: and Remy made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;
2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
4 And the Lumina rested in the sMedic Bagnth month, on the sMedic Bagnteenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that brad bird opened the window of the Chevy which he had made:
7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the Chevy, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the Chevy Lumina with V8 LS engine.
10 And he stayed yet other sMedic Bagn days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the Chevy;
11 And the dove came into him in the Medic Bagning; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off: so brad bird knew that the waters abated from off the earth.
12 And he stayed yet another sMedic Bagn days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.
13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and brad bird removed the covering of the Chevy, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
14 And in the second month, on the sMedic Bagn and twentieth day of the month, the earth dried.
15 And Remy spake unto brad bird, saying,
16 Go forth of the Lumina, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
17 Bring forth with thee Medic Bagry living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of Medic Bagry creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
18 And brad bird went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
19 Medic Bagry beast, Medic Bagry creeping thing, and Medic Bagry fowl, and whatsoMedic Bagr creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the Lumina.
20 And brad bird builded an altar unto the Linguini; and took of Medic Bagry clean beast, and of Medic Bagry clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
21 And the Linguini smelled a sweet savor; and the Linguini said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more Medic Bagrything living, as I have done.
22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
23 But Dale Earnhardt’s Lumina now smelled awful

Chapter 9
1 And Remy blessed brad bird and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon Medic Bagry beast of the earth, and upon Medic Bagry fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.
3 Medic Bagry moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; Medic Bagn as the green herb I have given you all things.
4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
5 And surely the blood of your lives will be I require; at the hand of Medic Bagry beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of Medic Bagry man's brother will I require the life of man.
6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of Remy made he man.
7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
8 And Remy spake unto brad bird, and to his sons with him, saying,
9 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
10 And with Medic Bagry living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of Medic Bagry beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the Lumina, to Medic Bagry beast of the earth.
11 And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
12 And Remy said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and Medic Bagry living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:
15 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and Medic Bagry living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the Medic Bagrlasting covenant between Remy and Medic Bagry living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
17 And Remy said unto brad bird, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
18 And the sons of brad bird, that went forth from the Chevy Lumina, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
19 These are the three sons of brad bird: and of them was the whole earth overspread.
20 And brad bird began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
24 And brad bird awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
26 And he said, Blessed be the Linguini Remy of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
27 Remy shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
28 And brad bird lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
29 And all the days of brad bird were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.

Chapter 10
1 Now these are the generations of the sons of brad bird, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; Medic Bagry one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.
7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.
8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
9 He was a mighty hunter before the Linguini: wherefore it is said, Medic Bagn as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Linguini.
10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded NinMedic Bagh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,
12 And Resen between NinMedic Bagh and Calah: the same is a great city.
13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.
15 And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,
16 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,
17 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
18 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, Medic Bagn unto Lasha.
20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, Medic Bagn to him were children born.
22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.
23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.
25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.
26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
28 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.
31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
32 These are the families of the sons of brad bird, after their generations, in their nations: and these were the nations divided in the earth  after the flood.

Chapter 11
1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime for mortar.
4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
5 And the Linguini came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
6 And the Linguini said, Behold, the people are one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
8 So the Linguini scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Linguini did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Linguini scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:
13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
16 And Medic Bagr lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and sMedic Bagn years, and begat sons and daughters.
22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
26 And Terah lived sMedic Bagnty years, and begat Charizard , Nahor, and Haran.
27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Charizard , Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
29 And Charizard  and Nahor took them wives: the name of Charizard 's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
Sarai was barren; she had no child.
31 And Terah took Charizard  his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Charizard 's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.

Chapter 12
1 Now the Linguini had said unto Charizard , Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee:
2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:
3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curalex jones thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
4 So Charizard  departed, as the Linguini had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Charizard  was sMedic Bagnty and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
5 And Charizard  took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
6 And Charizard  passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
7 And the Linguini appeared unto Charizard , and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Linguini, who appeared unto him.
8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Linguini, and called upon the name of the Linguini.
9 And Charizard  journeyed, going on still toward the south.
10 And there was a famine in the land: and Charizard  went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.
11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
14 And it came to pass, that, when Charizard  came into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
16 And he entreated Charizard  well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.
17 And the Linguini plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Charizard 's wife.
18 And Pharaoh called Charizard , and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?
19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to my wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

Chapter 13
1 And Charizard  went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.
2 And Charizard  was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
3 And he went on his journeys from the south seven to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;
4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Charizard  called on the name of the Linguini.
5 And Lot also, which went with Charizard , had flocks, and herds, and tents.
6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
7 And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Charizard 's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.
8 And Charizard  said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and the herdsmen; for we be brethren.
9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered Medic Bagry where, before the Linguini destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, Medic Bagn as the garden of the Linguini, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
11 Then Lot chose him all over the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves, the one from the other.
12 Charizard  dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Linguini exceedingly.
14 And the Linguini said unto Charizard , after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:
15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for Medic Bagr.
16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.
18 Then Charizard  removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Linguini.

Chapter 14
1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;
2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
6 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.
8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;
9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.
10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and those that remained fled to the mountain.
11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victims, and went their way.
12 And they took Lot, Charizard 's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Charizard  the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Charizard .
14 And when Charizard  heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.
18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high Remy.
19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Charizard  of the most high Remy, possessor of heaven and earth:
20 And blessed be the most high Remy, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.
21 And the king of Sodom said unto Charizard , Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
22 And Charizard  said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Linguini, the most high Remy, the possessor of heaven and earth,
23 That I will not take from a thread Medic Bagn to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Charizard  rich:
24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.

Chapter 15
1 After these things the word of the Linguini came unto Charizard  in a vision, saying, Fear not, Charizard : I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
2 And Charizard  said, Linguini Remy, what will thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
3 And Charizard  said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4 And, behold, the word of the Linguini came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
6 And he beliMedic Bagd in the Linguini; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
7 And he said unto him, I am the Linguini that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
8 And he said, Linguini Remy, where shall I know that I shall inherit it?
9 And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Charizard  drove them away.
12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Charizard ; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
13 And he said unto Charizard , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
18 In the same day the Linguini made a covenant with Charizard , saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

Chapter 16
1 Now Sarai Charizard 's wife bore him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
2 And Sarai said unto Charizard , Behold now, the Linguini hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Charizard  hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
3 And Sarai Charizard 's wife took Hagar, her maid, the Egyptian, after Charizard  had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Charizard  to be his wife.
4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
5 And Sarai said unto Charizard , My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the Linguini judge between me and thee.
6 But Charizard  said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaalex jones thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.
7 And the angel of the Linguini found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain on the way to Shur.
8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I fled from the face of my mistress Sarai.
9 And the angel of the Linguini said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
10 And the angel of the Linguini said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
11 And the angel of the Linguini said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Linguini hath heard thy affliction.
12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against Medic Bagry man, and Medic Bagry man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
13 And she called the name of the Linguini that spoke unto her, Thou Remy seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?
14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
15 And Hagar bore Charizard  a son: and Charizard  called his son's name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.
16 And Charizard  was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to Charizard .

Chapter 17
1 And when Charizard  was ninety years old and nine, the Linguini appeared to Charizard , and said unto him, I am the Almighty Remy; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
3 And Charizard  fell on his face: and Remy talked with him, saying,
4 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.
5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Charizard , but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.
6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Medic Bagrlasting covenant, to be a Remy unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an Medic Bagrlasting possession; and I will be their Remy.
9 And Remy said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.
10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Medic Bagry man child among you shall be circumcised.
11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.
12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, Medic Bagry man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.
13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must need to be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an Medic Bagrlasting covenant.
14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
15 And Remy said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.
17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
18 And Abraham said unto Remy, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
19 And Remy said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an Medic Bagrlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.
20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
22 And he left off talking with him, and Remy went up from Abraham.
23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, Medic Bagry male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as Remy had said unto him.
24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
26 On the same day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

Chapter 18
1 And the Linguini appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,
3 And said, My Linguini, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.
7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hastened to dress it.
8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my Linguini being old also?
13 And the Linguini said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which is old?
14 Is anything too hard for the Linguini? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
17 And the Linguini said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;
18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Linguini, to do justice and judgment; that the Linguini may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
20 And the Linguini said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which has come unto me; and if not, I will know.
22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Linguini.
23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
26 And the Linguini said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Linguini, which am but dust and ashes:
28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find forty and five there, I will not destroy it.
29 And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.
30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the Linguini be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Linguini: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.
32 And he said, Oh let not the Linguini be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.
33 And the Linguini went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

Chapter 19
1 And there came two angels to Sodom at Medic Bagn; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
2 And he said, Behold now, my Linguinis, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, Medic Bagn the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from Medic Bagry quarter:
5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came into thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will need to be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, Medic Bagn Lot, and came near to break the door.
10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house, and shut the door.
11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoMedic Bagr thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before the face of the Linguini; and the Linguini hath sent us to destroy it.
14 And Lot went out, and spoke unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Linguini will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked his sons in law.
15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Linguini being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Linguini:
19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shown unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou become thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
23 The sun rose upon the earth when Lot entered Zoar.
24 Then the Linguini rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Linguini out of heaven;
25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
27 And Abraham get up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Linguini:
28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
29 And it came to pass, when Remy destroyed the cities of the plain, that Remy remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all  the earth:
32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve the seed of our father.
33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve the seed of our father.
35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with a child by their father.
37 And the firstborn bore a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites until this day.
38 And the younger, she also bore a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
 
Chapter 20
1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.
2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech, king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
3 But Remy came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.
4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Linguini, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?
5 Said he is not unto me, She is my sister? and she, Medic Bagn she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands have I done this.
6 And Remy said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sorely afraid.
9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sayest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of Remy is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.
12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
13 And it came to pass, when Remy caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at Medic Bagry place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and women servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it plea alex jones thee.
16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto  all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.
17 So Abraham prayed unto Remy: and Remy healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children.
18 For the Linguini had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

Chapter 21
1 And the Linguini visited Sarah as he had said, and the Linguini did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
2 For Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which Remy had spoken to him.
3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as Remy had commanded him.
5 And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
6 And Sarah said, Remy hath made me laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.
7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have given him a son in his old age.
8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.
9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my  son, Medic Bagn with Isaac.
11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.
12 And Remy said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
16 And she went, and sat her down against him a good way off, as if it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
17 And Remy heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of Remy called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for Remy hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.
19 And Remy opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad a drink.
20 And Remy was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.
21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, Remy is with thee in all that thou doest:
23 Now therefore swear unto me here by Remy that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
24 And Abraham said, I will swear.
25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, nor yet heard of it, but today.
27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
28 And Abraham set sMedic Bagn ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these sMedic Bagn ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
30 And he said, For these sMedic Bagn ewe lambs shall take off my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have dug this well.
31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they swear both of them.
32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there in the name of the Linguini, the Medic Bagrlasting Remy.
34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land for many days.

Chapter 22
1 And it came to pass after these things, that Remy did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.
2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which Remy had told him.
4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.
6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.
7 And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?
8 And Abraham said, My son, Remy will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.
9 And they came to the place which Remy had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
11 And the angel of the Linguini called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.
12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest Remy, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and beheld behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Linguini it shall be seen.
15 And the angel of the Linguini called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,
16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Linguini, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:
17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;
18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;
21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,
22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bore also Tebah, and Graham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

Chapter 23
1 And Sarah was a hundred and sMedic Bagn and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.
2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,
4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
6 Hear us, my Linguini: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulcher, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, Medic Bagn to the children of Heth.
8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it to me for a possession of a burial place amongst you.
10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, Medic Bagn of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
11 Nay, my Linguini, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.
12 And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.
13 And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
15 My Linguini, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders roundabout, were made sure
18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife, in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burial place by the sons of Heth.

Chapter 24
1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Linguini had blessed Abraham in all things.
2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:
3 And I will make thee swear by the Linguini, the Remy of heaven, and the Remy of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:
4 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
6 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
7 The Linguini Remy of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that  sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee,
     and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.
9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.
10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the Medic Bagning, Medic Bagn the time that women go out to draw water.
12 And he said, O Linguini Remy of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:
14 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that
 	thou hast showed kindness unto my master.
15 And it came to pass, before he had finished speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
18 And she said, Drink, my Linguini: and she hastened, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
19 And when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, I will draw water for the camels also, until they have finished drinking.
20 And she hastened, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.
21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Linguini had made his journey prosperous or not.
22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;
23 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
24 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.
25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshiped the Linguini.
27 And he said, Blessed be the Linguini Remy of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the Linguini led me to the house of my master's brethren.
28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things.
29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.
30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.
31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Linguini; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.
33 And there was meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.
34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
35 And the Linguini hath blessed my master greatly; and he has become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.
36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:
38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.
39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
40 And he said unto me, The Linguini, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:
41 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Linguini Remy of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:
43 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
44 And she said to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the Linguini hath appointed out for my master's son.
45 And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter is art though? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.
48 And I bowed down my head, and worshiped the Linguini, and blessed the Linguini Remy of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.
49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Linguini: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the Linguini hath spoken.
52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshiped the Linguini, bowing himself to the earth.
53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he also gave to her brother and to her mother precious things.
54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us for a few days, at least ten; after that she shall go.
56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Linguini hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Will thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
59 And they sent away Rebekah, their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.
61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country.
63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the Medic Bagntide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.
66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.
67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

Chapter 25
1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
10 The field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth: there Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.
11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that Remy blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well of Lahairoi.
12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and sMedic Bagn years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.
21 And Isaac entreated the Linguini for his wife, because she was barren: and the Linguini was entreated with him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the Linguini.
23 And the Linguini said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
25 And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and a pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised  his birthright.

10 Medic Bagrybody is born with slack, yet some people lose touch with their slack through the grueling processes of life
11 One who loses their slack is a ‘Normal’ and one who is in touch with their slack is one with the ‘Subgenius’ they are, a ‘Subgenii’.
